The goal of this project is use reinforcement learning create a model to learn how to play tetris optimally. 
* We use Deep-Q-Learning to create our model
* 3 hidden layers with 64, 64, and 32 hidden nodes respectively
* We were able to train the model to run continuously for about 2-3 minutes after several hours of training
